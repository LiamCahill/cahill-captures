## About

Cahill Captures is a private family and friends social network — a warm, intentional alternative to the noise of modern social media. There are no algorithms pushing content at you, no notification-driven dopamine loops, and no invasive data collection. Just a calm, casual place to share moments, connect with people you care about, and feel good doing it.

Whether you're sharing a photo from a weekend adventure, a recipe you loved, or just a thought worth remembering, Cahill Captures is your community's personal corner of the internet.
